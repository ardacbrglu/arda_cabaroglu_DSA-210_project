# Arda Cabaroglu Project for DSA 210 

## Motivation
Hello, my name is Arda CabaroÄŸlu (32270). For this project, I want to explore how my physical activity levels, specifically the active energy calories I burn each day, fluctuate during my midterm examination periods.

## What is Active Energy?
Active energy, also known as active calorie expenditure, refers to the calories burned through physical activities such as walking, exercising, or other movements throughout the day. Unlike resting energy, which refers to the calories burned to maintain basic bodily functions, active energy focuses specifically on the energy used during intentional physical activity.

## Data Source
I will be using data collected from my Apple Watch, focusing on active energy calorie expenditure recorded each day for (approximately) one month, which includes a period of midterm exams. The data is recorded automatically by my Apple Watch and synchronized with the Health app on my iPhone. I will export this data as an XML file from the Health app, and convert it to a usable format using Python libraries such as Pandas, Beautiful Soup to parse and transform it into a suitable format for analysis.


## Data Analysis Plan
1) Import the XML file
2) Use the python library "Beautiful Soup" to parse XML and extract relevant calorie data 
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use Pandas library to understand the data distribution and identify trends or anomalies during both midterm and regular periods..
4) Visualization: Use libraries such as Matplotlib to create visualizations to highlight changes in daily active energy calorie expenditure
5) Statistical Analysis: I will perform correlation analysis to determine if there is a strong relationship between the calorie expenditure during regular weeks and midterm weeks.

## Goal
My primary goal is to see if there is a notable change in my active energy calorie expenditure, reflecting physical activity levels, during midterm exam periods compared to regular weeks.
