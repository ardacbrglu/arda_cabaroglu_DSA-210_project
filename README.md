Project for DSA 210 

Hello my name is Arda Cabaroglu (32270) For this project, i want to explore how my physical activity levels, specifically the calories i burn each day, fluctuate during my midterm examination periods. 

Data Source
1) Data collected from my Apple Watch, specifically the calories burned each day for a certain period that includes both regular weeks and midterm weeks. The data is recorded through the health app on my iphone which is synchronized with my Apple Watch.
2) I will import my own data from the health app as an XML file, and convert it to a usable format using Python libraries such as Pandas, Beautiful Soup to parse and transform data into suitable format for the analysis.

Data Analysis Plan
1) Import the XML file
2) Use the python library "Beautiful Soup" to parse XML and extract relevant calorie data 
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use Pandas library to understand the data distribution and identify trends or anomalies during both periods.
4) Visualization: Use libraries such as Matplotlib to create visualizations to highlight changes in daily calorie expenditure
5) Statistical Analysis: I will perform correlation analysis to determine if there is a strong relationship between the calorie expenditure during regular weeks and midterm weeks.


Goal
My primary goal is to see if there is a notable difference in my pyhsical activity levels during my midterm exam periods.
