# Arda Cabaroglu Project for DSA 210 

## Motivation
Hello my name is Arda Cabaroglu (32270) For this project, I want to explore how my physical activity levels, specifically the calories I burn each day, fluctuate during my midterm examination periods.

## Data Source
I will be using data collected from my Apple Watch, specifically the calories burned each day for (approximately) one month, which includes a period of midterm exams. The data is recorded automatically by my Apple Watch and synchronized with the Health app on my iPhone. I will export this data as an XML file from the Health app, and convert it to a usable format using Python libraries such as Pandas, Beautiful Soup to parse and transform it into a suitable format for analysis.


## Data Analysis Plan
1) Import the XML file
2) Use the python library "Beautiful Soup" to parse XML and extract relevant calorie data 
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use Pandas library to understand the data distribution and identify trends or anomalies during both midterm and regular periods..
4) Visualization: Use libraries such as Matplotlib to create visualizations to highlight changes in daily calorie expenditure
5) Statistical Analysis: I will perform correlation analysis to determine if there is a strong relationship between the calorie expenditure during regular weeks and midterm weeks.

## Goal
My primary goal is to see if there is a notable difference in my pyhsical activity levels during my midterm exam periods.
