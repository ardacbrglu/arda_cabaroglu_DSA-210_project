# Arda Cabaroglu Project for DSA 210 

## Motivation
Hello, my name is Arda CabaroÄŸlu (32270). For this project, I want to explore how my physical activity levels, specifically the active energy calories I burn each day, fluctuate during my midterm examination periods. Additionally, I will examine and compare my step count data from this semester with last year's data to highlight how changes in academic workload impact my overall physical activity.


## What is Active Energy?
Active energy, also known as active calorie expenditure, refers to the calories burned through physical activities such as walking, exercising, or other movements throughout the day. Unlike resting energy, which refers to the calories burned to maintain basic bodily functions, active energy focuses specifically on the energy used during intentional physical activity.



## Data Source
I will be using data collected from my Apple Watch, focusing on:

1) Active Energy: Calorie expenditure recorded daily for approximately one month, including midterm exam periods.
2) Step Count: Daily step counts for this semester and last year for a similar period.

The data is recorded automatically by my Apple Watch and synchronized with the Health app on my iPhone. I will export this data as XML files from the Health app and convert them into usable formats using Python libraries such as Pandas and Beautiful Soup to parse and transform the data for analysis.


## Data Analysis Plan
1) Import the XML file
   
3) Use the python library "Beautiful Soup" to parse XML and extract relevant calorie and step count data
   
4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA); 
  -> Use Pandas to clean and structure the data.
  -> Explore the distribution of active energy calorie expenditure and step counts.
  -> Identify trends or anomalies during midterm weeks compared to regular weeks.
   
7) Visualization: Use libraries such as Matplotlib to create visualizations to highlight changes in daily active energy calorie expenditure, and the step count.
   
8) Statistical Analysis: I will perform correlation analysis to determine if there is a strong relationship between the calorie expenditure during regular weeks and midterm weeks and show the change in step counts compared to last year due to changes in academic workload.

## Goal
My primary goal is to determine if there is a notable change in my physical activity levels, reflected through active energy calorie expenditure and step counts, during midterm exam periods compared to regular weeks. Additionally, I aim to illustrate the impact of a more demanding academic workload this semester on my step counts by comparing them to last year's data, when my courses were less intensive.
By analyzing these patterns, I hope to gain insight into how academic stress and study habits influence daily physical activity.
